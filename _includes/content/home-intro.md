Hi, I am Prasenjeet Biswal. I am a second year Master's student at Georgia Institue of Technology. Currently, I am working in PoloClub of Data Science advised by Dr. Polo Chau. Recently, I started working on visualizing deep neural networks focused on adverarial datasets.

My current interests other than advanced machine learning techniques are learning about big data systems.
